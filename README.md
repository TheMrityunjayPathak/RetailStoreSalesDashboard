# Retail Store Sales Dashboard

Hello Everyone,

I made this Retail Store Sales Report in PowerBI with sample Data of a Store which I collected from Kaggle.

## Problem Statement

The aim of this Power BI Dashboard Project is to design a Retail Store Sales Report that provides a clear and concise overview of the Store's Sales performance, enabling the stakeholders to gain actionable insights.

## Sections in the Report

Report has Multiple Section's from where you can manage the Data, Like :

- Report Data can be sliced by Quater of Year to show Data of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4.

- Report Data can also be sliced by State to show sales of any particular State.

- It has cards showing Total Amount, Total Profit, Total Quantity of Sale.

- Report has a Bar Chart showing Total Profit by Month.

- I conditionally formatted the Bar Chart to show different color when there is loss in Business.

- Report has another Horizontal Bar Chart which shows Profit by Sub Category of Items.

- Then I have included a Donut Chart to show how much Quantity of Product is order through which Payment Mode.

- I also included a Donut Chart to show how much Quantity of Product is ordered in which Category.

- Then I included a Horizontal Bar Chart to show Top 4 Performing State in sales.

- And Lastly I included a Bar Chart to show Top 4 Customers of our Store.

- I have also included a ðŸ”„ Reset Button at the Top to clear all Slicer's.

- To use it hold CTRL and then click it to reset the Slicer's.
