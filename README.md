## Retail Store Sales Dashboard

Hello Everyone,

I made this Retail Store Sales Dashboard in Power BI with sample data of a store which I collected from Kaggle.

## Problem Statement

To design a Retail Store Sales Dashboard that provides a clear and concise overview of the Store's Sales performance enabling the owner to gain actionable insights.

## Sections in the Report

**Report has multiple section's from where you can manage the data, like :**

- Report data can be sliced by a quarter of the year to show the data of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4.

- Report data can also be sliced by state to show sales of any particular state.

- Report has cards showing Total Amount, Total Profit, Total Quantity of Sale.

- Report has a bar chart showing Total Profit by Month.

- I conditionally formatted the bar chart to show different color in case of profit and loss in the business.

- Report has another horizontal bar chart which shows Profit by Sub Category of Items.

- I have included a donut chart to show the quantity of products ordered through different payment mode.

- I also included a donut chart to show the quantity of products ordered in which category.

- Then I included a horizontal bar chart to show top 4 performing state in sales.

- And lastly, I included a bar chart to show top 4 customers of our store.

- I have also included a **Reset** button at the top to clear all slicer's.

- To use it hold CTRL and then click it to reset all the slicer's.
